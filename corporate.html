         <p><b>What is Femme-Unity, and why would people want to be a part of it?</b></p>
         
         <p>Femme Unity offer yoga classes designed specifically for middle-aged working single moms in the Netherlands. The classes provide an opportunity for moms to take a break for their busy schedules, in addition to the classes the women attending have an opportunity to socialize and network with like-minded women. 
          To ensure that the classes are accessible to as many moms as possible, the program offers flexible scheduling and payment options. Moms can choose to attend individual classes or sign up for a package of classes at a discounted rate. A small percentage of the subscription fees are set aside for scholarships for moms who may not be able to afford the full costs of the program, this way every mom is able to join Femme Unity. 
          </p>

          <p>Femme Unity provides a support system that some single moms may miss; it gives them the opportunity to take a break and get a sense of rest and tranquility. Using the magic of yoga, it allows them to improve their physical and mental health and their overall well-being while forming connections with other single moms.</p>

                  Dark orange can also represent determination, ambition, and a strong will. It is a bold and attention-grabbing color that can evoke feelings of adventure 
                  and excitement. Additionally, the color orange stands for a sense of urgency and is known for stimulating action.

            <br>

            <h6> <strong>Font choices</strong></h6>
            
            <p>For our website we decided to use two different fonts. For the text part of our website, we decided to go with the font "Times New Roman", as it is  a classic and versatile 
              font that has been widely used in digital media for decades. The font is easy to read and has a professional and authoritative feel. Additionally, the style adds calmth to 
              the overall website as it is not too destracting for the viewer.
  
              On the other hand, since our general font is basic and therefore not distracting, we decided to add a more playful font for our headings. For this font we used "Chicle", a modern google font
              that is perfect for adding a fun and whimsical touch to designs. It is a script font with flowing, cursive-like letterforms that give it a unique and distinctive look. 
              Its informal and friendly style makes it inviting for the viewer and gives a sense of creativity and approachability.
            </p> 
           <br>
            <h6> <strong>User interface patterns</strong></h6>
            <p>Femme Unity makes use of several interface patterns. Though we wanted to keep it simple and manageable for our target audience, we did want to include multiple elements, 
              such as cards and carousels. For our values, team, and services-read more sections we have decided to use the card interface pattern, whereas we used a carousel for our
              services-main section. We wanted to minimize the information given to the visitor, as to why we have decided to "hide" the services-read more card section by creating a href to 
              the actual page. Secondly, we wanted to give the viewer an idea of our values by keeping it simple and keep them from being distracted. This is why we made a card pattern for our
              values with just our values written out, in case the visitor would like to see what Femme Unity values and stands for. Additionally, we used cards for our "teams" section where we
              yet again kept it minimalistic but also added pictures of the team, so that the visitor is able to imagine a face behind the product as well as feel invited.
            </p>

           <br>

            <h6> <strong>The structure of the navigation and content</strong></h6>
            <p>In terms of the navigation and content of the Femme Unity website, it was important to us to not cause information overload for the visitors. Therefore, we made sure 
              to minimalize the information at first glance, and section the content into several pages (about, values, services, etc.). When it comes to our services, we designed our
              website so that the visitor was first able to see what kind of classes we offer and therefore our range, and if-and-when interested in a specific class, they are able to
              click on the "read more" button to find out more about the class. This way we will not overwhelm our visitors with information, but we will still be able to provide them 
              our options. Additionally, we created some cards with interesting information, which we made sure is spread equally over the pages and are all on the same level. This was 
              important to us, as we did not want to have any distractions on the website for our visitors. </p>

            <br>

            <h6> <strong>How does the website fit the values and personality of the brand?</strong></h6>
            <p>The Femme Unity website fits the values and personality of the brand, as the website makes use of the style choice given above. The website represents balance, warmth, support
              and calmness by the usage of the color scheme. This part we can connect to the personality of the brand, as our personality is related to balance (therefore yoga) and giving the 
              possibility to our target audience to relax and become one with themselves. As for the values, considering we at Femme Unity highly value fostering a sense of community, support within
              our community is crucial to us. We try to do so by introducing the team on the website, as we want our visitors to know who they are meeting in advance. Additionally, we want everyone to 
              feel included, as to why we offer as many yoga services as possible. This way we at Femme Unity hope we are able to offer everyone something to their liking.
            </p>

           <br>

            <h6> <strong>How does the website design fit the marketing and communication strategy?</strong></h6>
            <p>Our marketing and communication strategy was to  highlight the benefits of taking a break from the busy schedule that moms have, and to find a supportive community of like-minded women 
              trough yoga classes. Within the design of the website you see a lot of middle aged women, our target audience, practicing yoga. This way our website design is relatable for the women, 
              since the design and color use give out a sense of peace and rest, which aligns with our key message.
            </p>

           <br>

            <h6> <strong>How does the website design help showcase the unique value proposal of the product?</strong></h6>
            <p>Our unique value proposition is: Femme-Unity offers yoga classes, and after the class we offer an encouragement circle. This circle offers middle-aged single moms a break from their 
              busy day-to-day lives, and gives them the opportunity to create a supporting network. Within the website design are several yoga classes offered, which allows the customers to easily 
              see the sites purpose. Next to that, the vision and values are clearly stated and therefore it connects to the unique value proposition.

          <h4 id="production-3" class="mt-2">Testing Report</h4>
          
          <p><b>Testing goals</b></p>
          <p>With this usability testing report, we are trying to find out several things:</p>
          
          <p>Firstly, we would like to find out if the users think our website is clear and easy to navigate through. Meaning, Can they find the information that they want to find on our website, and can they do what they intended to do when getting on the website.
            So they have to evaluate the navigation and organization of our website.
            Next to that, we would like to find out if the users face errors or bugs on the website that we may have overseen.
            They will have to identify usability issues. </p>
          
           <p>Lastly, with this usability testing we can find out whether the users may face some problems or have any other additional tips and ideas that we can use to improve our website. 
           This can be either technical or design aspects.</p>
    
          
         <br>

         <p><b>Testing methods</b></p> 

            <p>We have decided to use the same people we used for our solution interview because they are part of our target group (middle aged women).</p>
            <p>We decided to use 1 tester per team member, so for us we are 4 members so we will do the user testing with 4 participants</p>
            <p>The participant will be making use of a laptop that is provided to them by us. This will be done in person and the screen will be recorded with a voice over or via a video. 
              The whole webiste of Femme-Unity will be used as the prototype, except for the corporate page.</p>
            
            <p>We will use the Think Aloud Protocol: where we will ask all participants to vocalize their thoughts as they are interacting with the website.  </p>
          

          <p><b>Testing results</b></p> 
          <p>After analyzing the feedback from users, it can be concluded that the UI and UX of the website have both positive and negative aspects. The visually appealing about page, consistent use of fonts, and easy navigation are some of the positive aspects of the website. The personal touch given to the homepage, such as the inclusion of a video, also makes for a good user experience.</p>
         <p>Moreover, the highly visually appealing design of the website gives participants a relaxed and calm feeling. Users also appreciated the video on the home page and the carousel on the "services" page, which helped to showcase the offerings of the business. Additionally, the use of Cards on the "team" page was well-received, as it provided a quick overview of the team members.</p>
         <p>One of the most appreciated aspects of the website was the use of fitting pictures and colors that catered to the target audience. The consistent color use was visually pleasing, and the pictures used were well-suited to the website's theme.</p>
         <p>However, there were some areas of the website that could be improved. Users pointed out that some alignments were not perfect, and the font usage could be improved, especially in non-heading texts.

          <b>Media tactics</b>
         
         <p>Based on the target audience, we will use Instagram to promote our brands with the goal to create awareness for our website. We will use Instagram because that is one of the platforms that our target audience uses most and therefore is one of the easiest places to reach them. We understand the platform the best and therefore can use it best to our advantages.  We will use Instagram as our only.  </p>
          <p>The unique strengths of Instagram are wide popularity with a big loyal customer base, ability of massive audience reach, ability to capitalize on trends and this way to engage with audiences by using e.g., hashtags.</p>
          <p>We will utilize on these unique strengths by making posts on Instagram and make use of hashtags and ads. We will conduct interviews with single moms for a personal touch to be able to successfully engage with our audience. We will use popular hashtags and captions that are relatable to the target audience.</p>
         
          <h6>Social media campaign and planning</h6>
          <p>The key message of the campaign is to highlight the benefits of taking a break from the busy schedule that the moms have and to find a supportive community of likeminded women through yoga classes. By using a combination of engaging visuals, relatable captions and fun hashtags, Femme-Unity can attract and retain its target audience on social media and achieve our communication objectives. </p>

          <p><i>See appendix 4 for our social media planning</i></p>
          <p><i>See appendix 5 for our instagram posts</i></p>
          
          <br>

            <i>Course of action</i>
            <p>First to create awareness for our brand we created an account on Instagram and created a bio.  </p>
            <p>"We offer yoga classes and support circles while creating a supportive and inclusive community for single middle-aged moms to come together and unite.</p>

            <p>With this bio we communicated our vision and values to any protentional costumers in a few sentences. Prior to this we had already created a logo and to introduce our logo to the costumers we made it our profile picture on Instagram. We started off with a 
              simple post of our logo and a caption ‘coming soon...’ we got more comments that expected and noticed people liked our logo. After this we made a post ‘introducing’ femme unity where 
              we explained the purpose of our classes in the caption. After this we made 2 similar posts with woman laughing and practicing yoga with our brand name, 
              promoting our yoga classes in the captions, and asking woman to ‘come over and unite’. We followed this up with a post on 5 mindfulness tips 
              and explained in the caption that ‘self-care is not a luxury but a necessity’. For this post we worked with a ‘’slide post’’ which means that we posted multiple pictures in one post. Our next post was the reveal of our website launch date, 
              we created a post similar to our first post with the logo because we saw many people liked our logo and wanted to include it again. We shared our vision once again in the caption and explained what our website will offer. </p>

              
                <h4 id="marketing-2" class="mt-4">Learning Points</h4>

                
                <b>Reflection</b>
                
              <p>One main reflection point for us was that Instagram posts weren’t getting as much interaction as we thought they would. On the first post we got around 17 likes which is more than we expected but we only got 4 comments. Once we started posting more and figuring out what our target audience enjoyed such as our logo and the wellness tips, we managed to quickly turn this around and increase the interaction on our posts. On one of our posts, we even managed to get around 17 comments, almost as much as it had likes.
                We also noticed that posting regularly worked to increase our reach and follower’s base. The more we posted the more followers we got. Eventually people even started to respond to our posts. Here we could also see what our followers where thinking about our brand and the classes. 
                We noticed that the content of the posts we make have a significant relation to the amount of reach it gets. The post where we shared tips on wellness and mindfulness got more interaction. Therefore, we decided to post 5 new wellness tips and just as predicted it got more interaction just like the first post with tips. It did better than 85% of our other posts according to Instagram. 
                </p>

                <p>We also noticed that next to the post with the tips the posts with the most likes and comments was the one of our logos where we announced our website release date. That was something we did not expect in terms of executing our media plan.</p>
                
                <p>Upon reflection we noticed that although our posts reach a lot of accounts it primarily reaches non followers, but the engaged audience are mostly followers. </p>
                
                <p>For our initial idea we wanted to have a Facebook page too.  For our Facebook page we thought it would be convenient to use a function in Facebook that would allow us to put a timer on posts so that we would not have to post it ourselves. This is an experience we learned from because we later noticed Facebook did not post these because of an internal error. This set us back because we then did not make the posts according to the plan, but it was a valuable learning moment for the future to always check if something is posted/communicated successfully. We also concluded that our target audience uses Instagram more, so we chose to focus on that and make sure we really covered that platform well. Therefore, we decided to scrap Facebook from our media plan for now and add more social media platforms in the future to increase our reach.</p>
                
                <b>Identified learning points</b>
                <ul>
                  <li>The content of the posts we make have a significant relation to the amount of reach it gets.</li>
                  <li>Frequency of posts matter.</li>
                  <li> The logo of femme unity does well within our audience.</li>
                  <li> We need to figure out how to make non followers into followers after they have been reached.</li>
                  <li>Special functions for posting cannot be relied on entirely, and need to be dubble checked.</li>
                  <li>To increase the reach of our target audience we should expand on social media platforms.</li>
                </ul>
          
          <h4 id="marketing-3" class="mt-4">Future Planning</h4>
          <ol>
            <li>	In the future we will continue to use a combination of engaging visuals, relatable captions, and fun hashtags to attract and maintain our target audience on social media.</li>
            <li>We will increase the frequency of our posts to posting 5 times a week because we noticed that when we started posting more regular our reach and follower base increased simultaneously. </li>
            <li>We will branch out on social media by adding multiple platforms such Facebook and TikTok to our social media channels. We have previously only focused on Instagram but in the future as we expand our brand, we will be ready to take on more than one platform.</li>
            <li>Make use of Instagram stories and reels (we can share snippets, customer reviews- and behind-the-scenes shots of the studio). The stories can be accompanied by fun stickers, GIFS, and hashtags to make them more shareable.  The reels are easy to share with other women to further our reach.</li>
            <li>Social media ads: targeted social media ads can be created that appear on the Instagram of Facebook feed of our target audience. The ads can feature a call-to-action button to sign up for a free trial or a special discount code. This will encourage them to try out the classes. </li>
            <li>Share more health and wellness tips: Femme-Unity can share health and wellness tips on its social media to provide value to its followers. These tips an include yoga poses, healthy recipes, and mindfulness practises. </li>
            <li>Host online workshops: Femme-Unity can host online workshops on topics such as stress management, self-care, and mindfulness. These workshops can be promoted and can help attract a wider audience beyond its current customer base. </li>
            <li>Collaborate with other brands: Femme-Unity can collaborate with other health and wellness brand or local businesses to offer discounts or special promotions to its followers. This can help expand its reach and attract new customers. </li>
          </ol>

          <b>Improved objectives</b>
          <p>Now that we have reflected on the execution or our previous communication and media plan we can improve on our objectives for if we were to continue our brand in the future. </p>
          <i>Reach objective</i>
          <p>Our reach objective for Femme-Unity’s social media platform was to reach a total number of 200 followers on Instagram by April 14th, 2023. We have not yet achieved this, up until now we have managed to reach 55 followers on Instagram. After evaluating this objective, we realised that perhaps it was a little too difficult to reach in such a small amount of time. Which is why for our new objective we want to gain 100 followers by the end of June, giving us enough time to reach a more obtainable objective. We will do this by focusing on continuing to create engaging content, using hashtags, writing relatable captions, building relationships with followers, and promoting the benefits of Femme-Unity’s yoga classes and community to reach a wider audience.</p>
          <i>Affect objective</i>
          <p>Our affect objective for Femme-Unity’s social media campaign was to create a sense of connection and understanding with our target audience of working middle-aged single moms living in the Netherlands. our plan was to measure this through likes. Our goal was to receive a total of 75 likes across our platform by the end of April 2023. So far, we have received a total of 176 likes across our platform and have not only achieved but surpassed our objective. Our improved objective will therefore be higher we want to achieve a total of 400 likes across our platform by the end of June 2023.We will achieve this by continuing to create authentic and relatable content on multiple platforms that resonates with our target audience, actively engaging with followers through comments, and monitoring and adjusting our social media strategy based on audience feedback and engagement data.  </p>
          <i>Response objective</i>
          <p>Our response objective for Femme-Unity’s social media campaign was to encourage engagement and advocacy amongst our target audience. Specifically, we wanted to have a total of 50 comments across all social media platforms by the end of April 2023. So far, we have achieved to get 55 comments across our social media posts. We have managed to get a lot of engagement in the comments with our brand of people showing excitement for our classes. Since this objective has gone very well, we have decided to increase the number of comments for our new objective. Our improved objective will be to gain 300 comments across all platforms by the end of June,2023. To achieve this objective, we will continue to focus on creating shareable content that aligns with our brand’s vision of creating a supportive and inclusive community of single middle-aged moms that offer each other emotional support, encouragement, and knowledge and advice to succeed in all areas of life. We will also engage with our followers through direct messages and encourage user-generated content to expand our reach and grow our community. Furthermore, like we mentioned in our future planning we want to expand on our social media by using more platforms, this will also help us to reach this objective even further.</p>

            <li>Working women</li>

            <li>Goals: focussing on personal well-being, and improving on work/life BredaUniversityofAppliedSciences</li>

            <li>They have a need that is not met and are therefore early adapters, since the women miss a support system and they are currently missing that. And there are no existing products or technologies that could help them to meet there need. </li>

          </ul>
          <p class="fw-bold">Unique value proposition</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Femme-unity offers yoga classes, and after the class it offers a support group, it provides middle aged single moms a break from their busy day-to-day life, and it gives them the opportunity to create a supporting network.  </li>
            
          </ul>
          <p class="fw-bold">Unfair advantage</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Access to an expert: one of the teams’ family members has experience with teaching yoga and working with single moms experiencing problems in their day-to-day life. So, she can teach the yoga classes, and afterwards guide the support group. Next to this, she is also part of the target group as she is a single middle-aged mom. </li>
          </ul>
          <p class="fw-bold">Channels</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Instagram was chosen as a main channel, because during our interviews we noticed that it was one of the most used platforms by the middle-aged single women. However, they did also mention Facebook, but we decided not to go for that platform since we wanted to put in all our efforts in one platform and would like to reach as many people as possible. We also know Instagram the best as a social media platform, and since it is so familiar, we thought we were more likely to have bigger results. We have all kinds of different posts: women who are enjoying yoga, women chatting after their yoga class, wellness tips, etc. We also use engaging captions to reach our target audience, as well as hashtags. </li>

          <ul>
            <li>Single class fee: We charge a fee for each individual yoga class, and it is set at €12.50. This is a usage fee-based revenue model. 
              <li>Subscription: the business offers a discounted rate for those who purchase a package deal of classes in advance. For instance, 10 yoga classes are offered for €115, providing a discount compared to paying for each individual class. This is a subscription-based revenue model. </li>
            <li>Merchandise: ones the business is rising in popularity we could sell branded merchandise, such as yoga mats, tote bags or t-shirts to generate additional revenue. This is an asset-sale based subscription model since Femme-Unity would sell ownership to a physical product.  </li>
              <li> Renting out our space: with advertising we want to let people know that it is possible to rent our space for a couple of hours, so people could host their events here. This would be a renting-based revenue model, since we would temporarily grant someone the exclusive right to use our space. </li>
              <li>Teacher training programs & workshop: we offer trainings and workshops to middle aged women who might be interested to become a yoga teacher. Since they must pay for the workshop and training this could be an additional revenue stream. This is a usage fee-based revenue model. </li>
          </ul>

          <p> Overall, the revenue model for the business is based on providing yoga classes for middle-aged single moms in the Netherlands and charging fees for attending these classes. The business generates revenue from multiple streams such as single class fees, package deals, scholarship fees and merchandise.

          <h4 class="mt-2">Validation of Assumptions</h4>
          
          <p>Assumption 1: By offering a combination of yoga classes and a supportive community environment, we will attract and retain a loyal customer base of middle-aged single moms living in the Netherlands During our problem interviews, we saw that most of them mist some kind of support, and we implemented this need with yoga classes and a support group. During our solution interviews, we provided them a prototype where they had yoga classes and support groups and they all found that this was a good solution to fulfill that need. </p>
          <p>Link to the lean canvas: This assumption is related to the Customer Segments section of the Lean Canvas and the Value Proposition section. By identifying our target audience, and providing an unique value proposition of a supportive community combined with yoga classes, we believe that we can build and retain customers who are seeking for a sense of support and a place to work on their mental- and physical health. This assumption will help with our marketing and branding strategies so we are ensured that we will reach our target audience and communicating our value proposition.  </p>
          
          <p>Assumption 2: the set price of €12.50 per class is a good price, since most of them find it cheap or exactly the right price for a new yoga business. By offering package deals and subscriptions for yoga classes, there is a possibility to generate a significant portion of our revenue and increase our customer loyalty. </p>
          <p>Link to the lean canvas: This assumption is linked to the Revenue Streams and Cost structure sections of the Lean Canvas. By offering package deals and subscriptions we can increase the predictability of our revenue and it will help us optimize our cost structure by reducing the need for constant marketing and advertising efforts to attract new customers since we will hopefully create a loyal customer base. </p>
         
          <h4 class="mt-2">Conclusion of the interviews</h4>

          <p>Problem interviews</p>
          <p> After conducting interviews, it is clear that most women are perfectly happy being single and are not actively looking for a romantic partner. There are many different reasons for this, like changes in the dating world or personal experiences with relationships, and some women just do not feel like pursuing a relationship currently. However, it is clear from the interviews that all the women miss some kind of support system in any way. This could mean getting emotional support, or even professional support. They mentioned that being single is fulfilling to them, but they did express a desire for more community events or social activities geared towards middle aged single, which could provide an opportunity to meet like-minded individuals in a low-pressure setting. </p>
          
          <p> Conclusion Interviews</p>
          <p>After conducting the solution interviews, we discovered some valuable insights. The women who were interviewed, were excited about the prices and loved the idea of combining yoga classes with a support group. However, they did mention that it maybe should be another word instead of support group. They appreciated the affordability of the program, which could eventually in the future could be a little bit more expensive.  
            During the interviews, the women expressed interest in having the option to form groups with the same women each time they attended the support group. They believed that seeing familiar faces would build trust and allow them to form deeper connections with each other over time. Additionally, some women didn’t feel the need to have a support group, but still liked the idea of having yoga classes with the same age group. Because this way they are not confronted with younger people, who might be able to do more, and this would make them feel more confident and comfortable during the yoga classes. Therefore, in the future we will consider offering separate options for the support groups and yoga classes to accommodate different preferences. They also spoke about the possibility of having a place where there children be taken care of while they are having their yoga classes, because this way it makes it easier for them to attend the yoga classes.  
            Overall, the interviews showed that there is a demand for a women’s support group and yoga business, but it’s also important to consider the needs and preferences of the target audience to create a successful engaging program.

The classes are designed to provide moms with a much-needed break from their hectic schedules, and to offer them an opportunity to socialize, and creating a supporting network with like-minded women. Since most moms have a lot on their plate, we will offer flexible scheduling options. Moms can choose to attend individual classes for €20,- or purchase a package of 10 classes at discounted rate of €115. This way, they can fit it in their busy schedules how they like it without any stress our pressure. 
              Since the costs of the program may be a barrier for some, we made it as accessible as possible, hence why the low price per class. But we will also set aside a small percentage of the fees for scholarships for moms who may not be able to afford the costs of the program. This way, every mom has the opportunity to join Femme-Unity and take part in the program regardless of their financial situation. 
              Our classes are led by an experienced yoga instructress, who understands the needs of middle-aged single moms since the has experience with teaching yoga, coaching single women and is a part of the target group herself. Within the classes we focus on relaxation, mindfulness, and self-care to help the moms find a balance and clarity amidst the chaos of their life. 
              At Femme-Unity we are committed to create a supportive and inclusive community for singe middle aged moms. We believe that by coming together and taking care of ourselves, we can empower ourselves and one another to live happier and healthier lives.
