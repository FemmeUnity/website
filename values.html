        <p class="floating-text-content-services"> 
          A crucial brand value for Femme Unity is providing a safe space. 
          We believe that every woman, every mother, deserves to have 
          a space where they feel supported, respected, and heard. We want to 
          create an environment where women can freely express themselves and 
          share their personal stories.  

          Our commitment to providing a safe space goes beyond physical safety. 
          We care about emotional well-being and strive to create an environment 
          of empathy and mutual respect. Every woman, every mother, can thrive in 
          this safe space, regardless of their background, identity, or circumstances.

          <p> At Femme Unity, we believe that taking time to care for oneself i
            s essential for maintaining physical, emotional, and mental well-being.
             As such, we want to inspire single mothers to integrate self-care as 
             part of their daily routine.  

            We offer self-care in the form of our yoga classes and support groups, 
            this way, we allow our members to do mindfulness exercises. We strive 
            to allow women to explore the magic of yoga and to learn to take time 
            for themselves of their busy schedule. We believe that self-care is 
            beneficial not only for mothers but also for those around them, 
            including their children.
